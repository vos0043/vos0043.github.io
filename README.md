# Python Test

This repository is meant to test and experiment with Travis functionality. Things like automated testing and deployment to GitHub pages.

## How to fill your Github Page?

We need to fill the page with something so why not meaningless ramblings to make it look like there's actually some content here.

```bash
This is how you replace 'Lorum Ipsum' successfully
```

## Usage

```python
import BS

for i in BS:
    if i == "content":    
        print 'Something that looks like content'
    else:
        print 'Lorem Ipsum'
```
